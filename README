DeDupe, a simple project to build a system to help remove duplicate files.
Copyright 2011 Paul Curry, pcurry@gmail.com

The goal of this project is to have a little bit of software that helps the user
consolidate potentially many duplicate files into one copy in one location. I have
as many as dozens of copies of some of my digital photographs lying around, 
which wastes drive space, and gets confusing.  So, trying to figure out a way to 
get that sorted more cleanly.

This code currently depends on the os.walk feature introduced in Python 2.6, so it is not 
backward-compatible with any Python before 2.6.  I haven't tested the code on Python 2.7 yet,
so I don't know that it will work or not.
